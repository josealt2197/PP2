First of March, it's clear to me
It's something that's uncomforting
Your body has a way with me
I'm exactly where I want to be
But I'm a long way from home

I know your voice, I know your face
This is something I cannot replace
Give me hope and give me doubt
Well I left you in but don'love you now
I'm a long way from home
'Cause we're a long way from home

You're missing out, don't walk away
I have nothing more to say
Can you see it in my dying face
You're acting like I care
Now is there anything that I can do
If there was would we be saying
You're a part of me and I'm a part of you
'Cause you're a part of me and I'm a part of you
'Cause you're a part of me and I'm a part of you
'Cause you're a part of me and I'm a part of you
